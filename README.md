# Docker-based WordPress development for dueprocessed.com

## Usage

- Docker must be installed locally [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
- Clone this repo
- Run `docker-compose up`

## Development

This is a simple environment for theme and plugin development. Note:

- WordPress will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- the `wp-content` folder you'll find in this repo will be shared with the WordPress installation, put your code there.

## Theme development

The theme files in `./wp-content/themes/due-processed` are generated by the `./due-processed` project built off of the [Underscores starter theme](https://underscores.me/).
Do not make changes directly to the files in `./wp-content/themes/due-processed`, instead make them in `./due-processed`
and regenerate them.

To make updates to the theme, first install the required dependencies in `./due-processed`:

```
$ cd ./due-processed
$ composer install
$ npm install
```

To see you updates locally, run:

```
npm run bundle
```

This command will lint, compile, and generate the proper theme files and output them into `./wp-content/themes/due-processed`.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit both the changes in `./due-processed` as well as the generated files in `./wp-content.

You can find additional documentation about the `_s` starter theme on [Github](https://github.com/Automattic/\_s) and [Wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/theme-development-examples/#the-underscores-theme).

## Plugin development

Add plugins in `./wp-content/plugins`.
